It all started with two love birds, Rizwan Izham Bin Mohd Zain and Sharizatul Eliza Binti Baseri. They both were destined to meet, funny enough, at work! They both worked at Crown Plaza, Kuala Lumpur. They fell in love and got married in 2001 and are still married to this day. 2 years later, they gave birth to a pretty cool son named Razin Hezral Bin Rizwan Izham (2003). After another 2 years, they also gave birth to one of the laziest people on planet earth, named Raqin Hisyam Bin Rizwan Izham (2005).
